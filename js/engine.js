  *
  * A game engine works by drawing the entire game screen over and over, kind of
  * like a flipbook you may have created as a kid. When your player moves across
  * the screen, it may look like just that image/character is moving or being
  * drawn but that is not the case. What's really happening is the entire "scene"
  * is being drawn over and over, presenting the illusion of animation.
  *
  * This engine is available globally via the Engine variable and it also makes
  * the canvas' context (ctx) object globally available to make writing app.js
  * a little simpler to work with.
